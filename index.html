      <ul>
        <li>When we first prepared to give this session at NYC Camp up in New York, we got feedback that surprised us from our male colleagues. Instead of saying, “That doesn’t sound like a real thing,” as I had personally expected, most said, “I’ve felt like that so often. I’d want to attend that.”</li>
        <li>Even if you’ve studied web development formally, the technology is always changing, and it’s easy to get behind and feel like you’re now in a position you lucked into and don’t deserve. For those of us who are self-taught, this can be even more insidious.</li>
        <li>I, for example, didn’t become a developer because I studied it. I became one because when I was 12, I taught myself HTML instead of playing sports. Almost 10 years later, I got a college internship coding email newsletters and quickly realized I loved development more than I loved the International Relations field my degree was in. Whoops.</li>
        <li>A lot of men follow this same path. Being self-taught and stumbling into your field, where code is usually under the scrutiny of your peers, can give you the feeling that you don’t really deserve to be doing what you’re doing, even when you excel at it -- textbook impostor syndrome. In short: This might be more common in women and other minority groups, but it can affect anybody.</li>

Realizing that not everybody has it all figured out-- not even people you perceive as the “experts”, who are so much better than you-- helps you recognize that you don’t have to suffer in a vacuum.

    <h2>Speak.</h2>
    <div class="notes">
      <ul>
        <li>Once you find the skills or topics that come naturally for you and start sharing your knowledge informally, you might realize that you want to do it on a larger scale. With both local and national events, the open source community -- and the Drupal community in particular -- makes it relatively easy to get started with speaking.</li>
      </ul>

    <p style="font-size:1.2em"><strong>Remember:</strong> You (yes, you) can do this.</p>
    <div class="notes">
      <ul>
        <li>The first thing to realize is that you can, and should, speak even if it makes you nervous.</li>
        <li>I remember meeting webchick for the first time at the Denver DrupalCon, my first DrupalCon. We talked at a bar and she told me that I should speak at events. And I was really surprised, because hell, it was my first time even going to DrupalCon, why would I speak at one? I briefly thought that I had accidentally misled her about my experience.</li>
        <li>But the next time a speaking opportunity came up, I took it, and I loved it. This session is the 9th one I’ve spoken at, on topics ranging from front-end to migration to site building to client management. </li>
      </ul>

  <div id="speak-3" class="subheader step hide" data-x="-1800" data-y="-2600" data-rotate-y="-90" data-scale="1">
    <p style="font-size:1.2em">Remind yourself that feedback will<br />
      make your first presentation <span class="offset">stronger</span>.</p>
    <div class="notes">
      <ul>
        <li>If you want to speak but you think, like I did, that you’re going to crash and burn if you try, know that there are a lot of feedback loops you can use before you get up on stage.</li>
        <li>You can get a topic and talk to that support network you built to see if it has legs.</li>
        <li>You can put a session proposal together and see if it’s what the event is looking for -- and if it gets accepted, congrats, it was!</li>
        <li>You can do a dry-run of the presentation for people you trust.</li>
        <li>In short, if you’re attracted to speaking, do it; when you do things that scare you, you find out what you love.</li>
      </ul>
